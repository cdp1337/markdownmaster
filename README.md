# MarkdownMaster CMS

Development has moved to [eVAL-Agency/MarkdownMasterCMS](https://github.com/eVAL-Agency/MarkdownMasterCMS)

With new website at [markdownmaster.com](https://markdownmaster.com)

---

MarkdownMaster CMS is a 100%* client-side, no-database, flat-file framework to 
render a full HTML site from flat Markdown content files and HTML templates, 
in the spirit of 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

This CMS behaves as a Single-Page Application and loads all files from the server via 
the auto-index feature in either 
[Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_autoindex.html)
or [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_autoindex_module.html) and performs 
all processing of templates and content within the browser.

Note* for SEO reasons, there is a server-side Python component
which will return a generated version of the requested page similar to the
client-side application.  This is unnecessary for normal users, but is required
to ensure that crawlers can access the site data.

This feature can be disabled via `.htaccess` or `nginx.conf` if desired.

Because there is no database, registry, or administration of pages, 
deploying new pages is as simple as just uploading Markdown files to your server.
This can be done via automated sync applications such as NextCloud or just uploading
via SFTP or your web hosting interface.  _No building or scripts needed for deployment!_

This project is originally based from
[Chris Diana's CMS.js](https://github.com/chrisdiana/cms.js).

## How it works

MarkdownMaster CMS takes advantage of the server's directory indexing feature. 
By allowing indexes, MarkdownMaster CMS sends an AJAX call to your specified folders 
and looks for Markdown and HTML files.
After they are found, it takes care of everything else and delivers a full website.

Bots and crawlers automatically get routed to `/cgi-bin/crawler.py` to have the 
server perform the markdown-to-HTML transformation. 
This script utilizes the same exact markdown files as normal visitors, 
so the content will be mostly consistent.


## Migration from Jekyll

**Importing Posts**

Once MarkdownMaster CMS is installed and running, simply copy all of your posts 
from your Jekyll project's `_post` folder to your designated MarkdownMaster CMS posts folder.

**Importing Pages**

Copy all of your Markdown pages from your Jekyll projects root folder into your 
designated MarkdownMaster CMS pages folder.

## Debugging

Debug mode can be enabled on your live site by appending `?testdebug=1` to the URL.
This will force the CMS into debug mode where messages are printed to the browser console.

Testing bot and crawler responses can be done by append `?testcrawler=1` to the URL.
This will route to the cgi-bin Python version of the site which should be seen by 
GoogleBot and crawlers.
